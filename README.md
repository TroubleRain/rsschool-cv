## Briefly About Myself:

I would like to become a front-end developer, creating truly useful and interesting websites and solving tasks that are necessary for their development. Among my strengths is always striving to do my work to the highest quality and in the best possible way, not giving up halfway due to failures, and completing my work. I have no work experience, except for small projects in university and self-made layouts. In the future, I want to learn various tools and their best application for my work
